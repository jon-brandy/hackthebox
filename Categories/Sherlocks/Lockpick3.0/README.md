## SCENARIO:

<p align="justify">The threat actors of the Lockpick variant of Ransomware seem to have increased their skillset. Thankfully on this occasion they only hit a development, non production server. We require your assistance performing some reverse engineering of the payload in addition to some analysis of some relevant artifacts. Interestingly we can't find evidence of remote access so there is likely an insider threat.... Good luck! Please note on the day of release this is being utilised for a workshop, however will still be available (and free).</p>
