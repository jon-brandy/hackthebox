## SCENARIO:

<p align="justify">A S1rBank client reported unauthorized transactions. The victim received an SMS urging a banking app update via a link, which installed a dormant app mimicking the bank’s official version. Once activated, it stole credentials, bypassed 2FA via SMS interception, and exfiltrated data. As a DFIR specialist, analyze the Android disk image to uncover the malware’s operation, reconstruct the attack chain, and identify critical IoCs.</p>
