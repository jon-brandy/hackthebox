## Lessons Learned:
1. ASDA

## SCENARIO:

<p align="justify">Forela.org’s IT Helpdesk has been receiving reports from employees experiencing unusual behaviour on their Windows systems. Within 30 minutes, the number of affected systems increased drastically, with employees unable to access their files or run essential business applications. An ominous ransom note appeared on many screens, asking the users to communicate with the ransomware group's customer service department. It became apparent that Forela.org was under a significant ransomware attack. As a member of Forela.org's Incident Response (IR) team, you have been assigned a critical task. A ticket has been created for you to reverse engineer the ransomware that has compromised Forela.org’s Windows systems. Your objective is to fully understand the ransomware’s capabilities and extract any Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to feed into the organisation’s detection tools, preventing further infection.</p>
