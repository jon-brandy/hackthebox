## SCENARIO:
<p align="justify">The university's IT team began receiving reports of strange activity on library computers. Students noticed hidden files appearing on their USB drives and disappearing moments later. An investigation revealed a single suspicious file named "SecretPictures." When opened, it vanished instantly without leaving a trace, and no antivirus tool could identify it. The IT team isolated the file and provided it for your analysis. As a cybersecurity analyst, your task is to determine what this malware does, how it spreads, and how to stop it before it affects more systems.</p>
